# Data Profiler Accelerator

## Overview 
The Data Profiler Accelerator conducts an automated exploratory analysis of all variables in your dataset and then creates a Domo dashboard with the following cards: 
- correlation matrix card that shows the correlations between variables;
- histogram and bar chart cards that show the distribution of variables; and
- scatterplot and bar chart cards that show the relationships between variables

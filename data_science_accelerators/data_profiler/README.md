# Data Profiler Accelerator

## Overview 
The Data Profiler Accelerator conducts an automated exploratory analysis of all variables in your dataset and then creates a Domo dashboard with the following cards: 
- correlation matrix card that shows the correlations between variables;
- histogram and bar chart cards that show the distribution of variables; and
- scatterplot and bar chart cards that show the relationships between variables

## Instructions 
1. Download the ```DataProfilerGUI_v5.ipynb``` file by going [here](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-data-science-resources/blob/main/data_science_accelerators/data_profiler/DataProfilerGUI_v5.ipynb)
2. In your Domo instance, create a Jupyter workspace that uses a **Python** kernel. See [here](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/36004740075?language=en_US#creating_workspace) for additional help.
3. Start/run the Jupyter workspace created in step 2. See [here](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/36004740075?language=en_US#running_workspace) for additional help.
4. In your running Jupyter workspace, upload the ```.ipynb``` file downloaded in step 1 by selecting the **Upload Files** button located in the left panel of the workspace. Open the ```.ipynb``` file by selecting the file, which should be listed in the file browser in the left panel of the workspace.
5. Run the cells in this notebook (Run > Run All Cells)
6. Add your login info and dataset ID, and click Login
7. Select the features you wish to run, and a page name for the output, and click Run Scaffolding

## Overview

The Data Anonymizer Accelerator creates an anonymized version of your dataset. The anonymized dataset maintains the aggregate characteristics of your dataset (i.e., correlations between and distributions of variables) without revealing information about observations within your dataset

**Correlation matrices generated by profiler:**

**Feature distribution comparisons generated by profiler:** 

Feature distributions in the anonymized dataset (red) vs. original dataset (blue). Purple coloring indicates overlapping/matching distributions. Categorical features are one-hot encoded and can be further anonymized with new category values/names (ex. see region_XX features).

## Instructions 
1. Download the ```anonymizer_v1.0.6.tar``` file by going [here](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-data-science-resources/blob/main/data_science_accelerators/data_anonymizer/anonymizer_v1.0.6.tar)
2. In your Domo instance, create a Jupyter workspace that uses a **R** kernel. See [here](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/36004740075?language=en_US#creating_workspace) for additional help.
3. Start/run the Jupyter workspace created in step 2. See [here](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/36004740075?language=en_US#running_workspace) for additional help.
4. In your running Jupyter workspace, upload the ```.tar``` file downloaded in step 1 by selecting the **Upload Files** button located in the left panel of the workspace. 
5. Also in your running Jupyter workspace, open a new terminal window by selecting **File > New > Terminal**. Type the following code in the terminal window and hit **Enter**: ```tar -xf ﻿anonymizer_v1.0.6.tar``` (note: do not copy and paste the code from here or you will get an error). A new folder named ‘anonymizer’ should appear in the File Browser in the workspace left-side panel.
6. Open the ‘anonymizer’ folder and select the ```anonymizer_v1.0.6.ipynb``` notebook file. The notebook should open in the main work area. Proceed to follow the steps outlined in the notebook to use the data anonymizer.
7. If you have successfully created an anonymized version of your dataset, that anonymized dataset should be available in the DataSets section of your Domo instance. The default name of the anonymized dataset is ‘Anonymized Data’.

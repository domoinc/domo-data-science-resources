# Data Anonymizer Accelerator

## Overview

The Data Anonymizer Accelerator creates an anonymized version of your dataset. The anonymized dataset maintains the aggregate characteristics of your dataset (i.e., correlations between and distributions of variables) without revealing information about observations within your dataset

## Instructions 
1. Download .TAR file here
2. Create a Jupyter workspace that uses an R kernel. See here for additional help
3. Start/run the Jupyter workspace created in step 2. See here for additional help.
4. In your running Jupyter workspace, open a new terminal window by selecting File > New > Terminal. Type the following code in the terminal window and hit Enter: tar -xf ﻿anonymizer_v1.0.6.tar. A new folder named ‘anonymizer’ should appear in the File Browser in the workspace left-side panel.
5. Open the ‘anonymizer’ folder and select the anonymizer_v1.0.6.ipynb notebook file. The notebook should open in the main work area. Proceed to follow the steps outlined in the notebook to use the data anonymizer.
6. If you have successfully created an anonymized version of your dataset, that anonymized dataset should be available in the DataSets section of your Domo instance. The default name of the anonymized dataset is ‘Anonymized Data’.

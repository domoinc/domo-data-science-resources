# Data Science Accelerators 
Accelerators are packaged automation tools using Jupyter Workspaces that simplify and streamline different parts of the data science process to remove speed bumps and accelerate results.

3 Data Science Accelerators are currently available: 
  - [Data Anonymizer](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-data-science-resources/tree/main/data_science_accelerators/data_anonymizer): creates an anonymized version of your dataset. The anonymized dataset maintains the aggregate characteristics of your dataset (i.e., correlations between and distributions of variables) without revealing information about observations within your dataset
  - [Data Profiler](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-data-science-resources/tree/main/data_science_accelerators/data_profiler): conducts an automated exploratory analysis of all variables in your dataset and then creates a Domo dashboard that displays the exploratory analysis results
  - [Model Insights](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-data-science-resources/tree/main/data_science_accelerators/model_insights): creates a comprehensive model insights dashboard that includes live model performance evaluation, model monitoring (feature drift & model pipeline function), feature importance & correlations, insights into individual predictions, & training performance evaluation.

If you have questions about or encounter issues when using the accelerators, contact datascienceSME@domo.com.
